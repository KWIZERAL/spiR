<a href="#summary" class="anchor"></a>Summary</h1>
<p>The spiR package is intended to make two simple contributions: (1) to give access to new societal and economic data and (2) to integrate easily in a researcher’s workflow through the R language.</p>
<p>By providing new open data in an integrated way, it highlights some other principles: open data, open code, open and reproducible science. The novelty of the data, collected and computed by the Social Progress Imperative whose advisory board is chaired by Professor Michael Porter (Harvard Business School), helps inform better policy decisions when it comes to accelerate efforts to drive equitable, inclusive and thriving societies.</p>
<p>Updated on a quarterly basis, the R package contains 72 metadata, covers 194 countries from 2014 and is rich of 1434 observations. It is also expanding by providing access to other data sources in order to augment the level of geographic granularity, while making sure data comparisons are consistent.</p>

<a href="#motivation" class="anchor"></a>Motivation</h1>
<p>The spiR package was developped to facilitate the access to new indicators measuring social progress while being in the open data spirit. ‘spiR’ is an R package to easily access the Social Progress Index datasets. It is inspired by several other initiatives in the open data space <span class="citation">(Kim et al., 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>This R package provides a collection of new indicators to compute complexity metrics that offer an easy access to these data for social scientists <span class="citation">(Vargas, 2020)</span>. Indeed, in the past decade, a new field has emerged: Economic Complexity. Economic Complexity is a data-driven approach that may be used to inform the territorial development policies with evidence-based metrics. An interdisciplinary analytical framework by essence, Economic complexity stands at the crossroads between evolutionary economics and institutional economics <span class="citation">(Cimoli &amp; Dosi, 1995; Hirschman, 1958; Teece, Rumelt, Dosi, &amp; Winter, 1994)</span>. It was originally designed to analyze the determinants of economic development. Driven by an inferential approach, the need for new indicators and new data has occurred. In our current technological “state of the art”, it is important for social scientists to take advantage of the new possibilities. Social scientists can leverage technologies to have access to new kinds of data (structured and unstructured) and compute new indicators. The goal is the same: to better understand - and hence inform - individuals in their interactions with societies and societies themselves.</p>
<p>The differences with the previous literature are essentially twofold. First, at the theoretical level, this literature proposes to consider different dimensions (industries and product spaces) shifting the focus away from only aggregate variables <span class="citation">(Hidalgo &amp; Hausmann, 2009; Tacchella, Cristelli, Caldarelli, Gabrielli, &amp; Pietronero, 2012)</span>. The second difference is the result of researchers having a better access to computing power and data. Indeed, with respect to the previous literature, Economic Complexity is by nature data-intensive and compting-power intensive. With the current acceleration in computing power access and open data initiatives across the world, Economic Complexity can now be used to provide complementary analyses to more conventional macroeconomic methods. The shift in granularity allowed by this new access to data allows researchers to answer quantitatively to several policy relevant questions.</p>
<p>In the field of Economic Complexity, open data initiatives constitute essential resources. Across the world, the question of facilitating the access to socioeconomic data is widespread and well established nowadays. While people are more and more connected, the need to provide reliable sources of information as well as providing validated data to form better decisions has become crucial and well understood. In this context, governments, research centers, private companies, NGOs and think tanks at different levels have started to build open data initiatives. Another related goal is to rely on reproducible research principles. By building up a workflow of integrated tools such as data, code and methods, a researcher can share her results more widely in a reproducible spirit.</p>
<p>In 2015, The 17 United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals were adopted. ‘spiR’ is a package comprised of several open datasets, which are published by the Social Progress Imperative (<a href="https://www.socialprogress.org/" class="uri">https://www.socialprogress.org/</a>), including the Social Progress Index (a synthetic measure of human development across the world) <span class="citation">(Progress, 2020)</span>. ‘spiR’‘s goal is to provide data to help policymakers and researchers prioritize actions that accelerate social progress across the world in the context of the Sustainable Development Goals. The Social Progress Index proposes a new perspective on social challenges and needed efforts to accelerate social progress in line with the Sustainable Development Goals. In this context, the goal of ’spiR’ is to allow an easy connection with R to the Social Progress Index.</p>
<p>At the Social Progress Imperative, they define “social progress as the capacity of a society to meet the basic human needs of its citizens, establish the building blocks that allow citizens and communities to enhance and sustain the quality of their lives, and create the conditions for all individuals to reach their full potential. Improving quality of life is a complex task and past efforts to measure progress simply haven’t created a sufficiently nuanced picture of what a successful society looks like. That’s why we created the Social Progress Index. Rather than emphasizing traditional measurements of success like income and investment, we measure 51 social and environmental indicators to create a clearer picture of what life is really like for everyday people. The index doesn’t measure people’s happiness or life satisfaction, focusing instead on actual life outcomes in areas from shelter and nutrition to rights and education. This exclusive focus on measurable outcomes makes the index a useful policy tool that tracks changes in society over time.”</p>
<p>Having an easy access to these data has an outstanding impact on education and research. New research questions can be answered thanks to the new level of data availabilitym while being able to tap into the “wisdom of crowds” (<span class="citation">Gal (2019)</span>, <span class="citation">Cai, Gippel, Zhu, &amp; Singh (2019)</span>, <span class="citation">De C. Wang et al. (2019)</span>, <span class="citation">Avasilcai &amp; Galateanu (2018)</span>). In the past, there were lots of areas in public policy-making where data were not accessible. As a result, decisions were made on asssumptions coming from theoretical foundations or from benchmarks from other sources. Numerous authors have demonstrated the role of data in informing better evidence-based policies (<span class="citation">Wolffe, Whaley, Halsall, Rooney, &amp; Walker (2019)</span>, <span class="citation">Payán &amp; Lewis (2019)</span>, <span class="citation">Giménez‐bertomeu, Domenech‐lópez, Mateo‐pérez, &amp; De‐alfonseti‐hartmann (2019)</span>, <span class="citation">Villumsen, Faxvaag, &amp; Nøhr (2019)</span>).</p>

<h1 class="hasAnchor">
<a href="#functionality-and-reproducible-demonstration" class="anchor"></a>Functionality and Reproducible demonstration</h1>
<p>The index measures the quality of life for 98% of the world’s population. In its current version, the R package provides access to global data. In further versions, this package will include different geographical levels: states, regions, cities and sometimes communities. We will also include education and innovation indicators to capture the dynamics of social progress across the world <span class="citation">(Hadengue &amp; Warin, 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Three overarching dimensions are (1) Basic Human Needs, (2) Foundations of Wellbeing, and (3) Opportunity. Within each dimension, there are four components that further divide the indicators into thematic categories. The index consists in 51 social and environmental variables, covering the years 2014 to 2019.</p>
<p>spiR covers 72 metadata (mostly economic and societal variables) and contain 1434 observations for each metadata from 2014 to 2019 across 194 countries. These data are easily accessible through three functions: (1) to select the country, (2) to select the indicator(s) and (3) to collect the data in a directly usable dataframe.</p>

<p>The functions in spiR are:</p>
<ul>
<li>spi_country()</li>
<li>spi_indicator()</li>
<li>spi_data()</li>
</ul>
<p>In three easy steps, a researcher can integrate spiR’s data into her workflow.</p>
<p>First, the user needs to enter the ISO code of a country. To have access to this code, the following function provides this information: spi_country(). This function provides a list of all the countries available in spiR. spi_country(country = “Canada”) provides the ISO code of the country.</p>
<p>Second, the user needs to specify which indicator is of interest. Again, spi_indicator() generates a list of all indicators. Then, it is possible to specify which indicator needs to be targeted: for instance, spi_indicator(indicators = “mortality”) generates a list of indicators with “mortality” in their titles.</p>
<p>Third, once the user knows the ISO code and the indicator’s code, she can collect the data in a very easy way through this function:</p>
<p>spi_data(country = c(“USA”, “FRA”), year = c(“2018”, “2019”), indicators = “SPI”) # It generates a data frame of the overall SPI indicator for the USA and France for the years 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>Other ways are possible, following the R grammar, for instance: spi_data(country = c(“USA”, “FRA”), years = “2018”, ) generates a data frame of all the indicators for the USA and France for the year 2018. The GitHub vignette (&lt;www.github.com/warint/spiR&gt;).</p>
