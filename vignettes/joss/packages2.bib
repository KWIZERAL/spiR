In this research we focus on another piece of the puzzle, which is often overlooked but can play a significant role in shaping market structure and conduct: the users of the platform - whether suppliers or consumers (hereinafter jointly or severally: "the crowd"). As will be shown, the power of the crowd can both positively and negatively affect social welfare. Accordingly, this paper seeks to recognize the effects of crowd power and to identify both market-based as well as regulatory solutions to increase its welfare-increasing qualities, while reducing its negative ones. To do so, the study develops in a three stages. The first part explores the welfare effects of the sharing economy on the crowd. This serves as a basis for the second part, which focuses on the role of the crowd in shaping sharing platform markets. The third part then explores the potential role, as well as the limitations, of regulation in ensuring that crowd actions increase welfare. As will be shown, the current legal framework which regulates crowd actions might limit the realization of some of the potential positive effects of social platforms. In particular, new thinking might be needed with regard to rules regulating the use of crowd power to counteract a dominant sharing platform's market power. \textcopyright{} 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

  abstract = {Nowadays the customers changed their roles from co-producers to co-creators as a result of technology disclosure, open innovation acknowledgement and the use of innovation as the main driver for organizational growth. This switch to a complex and adaptive ecosystem became an anchor point for the development of new products, especially within value co-creation processes. From this point of view, the emerging industries are the most relevant for key aspects identification in terms of innovative products and processes, and creativity enhancement. This paper aims to highlight the main features of crowdsourcing implementation within these industries. The research methodology is based on the use of case study approach in order to illustrate how creative companies implement crowdsourcing within their activities. Thus, there will be identified the most relevant features and crowdsourcing activities or processes adopted by the company Crowdspring. A detailed analysis of the platform will reveal how company interacts with their clients or other relevant stakeholders. Also, there will be highlighted the importance of the power of crowd within product development process, starting from the ideation stage. The analysis of creative industries platforms, such as Crowdspring, will reveal the main process of ideas gathering, development and implementation through creative tasks. \textcopyright{} Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

To enable richer insights regarding questions related to learning and education, LA solutions should be able to integrate data coming from many different data sources, which may be stored in different formats and have varying levels of structure. Data integration also plays a role for the scalability of LA, an important challenge in itself. The objective of this review is to assess the current state of LA in terms of data integration in the context of higher education. The initial search of six academic databases and common venues for publishing LA research resulted in 115 publications, out of which 20 were included in the final analysis. The results show that a few data sources (e.g., LMS) appear repeatedly in the research studies; the number of data sources used in LA studies in higher education tends to be limited; when data are integrated, similar data formats are often combined (a low-hanging fruit in terms of technical challenges); the research literature tends to lack details about data integration in the implemented systems; and, despite being a good starting point for data integration, educational data specifications (e.g., xAPI) seem to seldom be used. In addition, the results indicate a lack of stakeholder (e.g., teachers/instructors, technology vendors) involvement in the research studies. The review concludes by offering recommendations to address limitations and gaps in the research reported in the literature. \textcopyright{} 2019, The Author(s).},

  abstract = {Addressing the translational gap between research evidence and state health policy requires an understanding of the current use of research evidence in the state policymaking process. In this study, we explore the use of research evidence to inform the legislative debate about restaurant nutrition labeling policy in California. In 2008, California was the first state to enact a mandatory menu calorie labeling policy in the U.S. Using a qualitative approach, we examine data sources and types of evidence used in legislative documents (n = 87) related to six menu labeling bills introduced in California's state legislature between 2003 and 2008. Federal- and state-level government agency reports were the most frequently cited sources of technical knowledge. Advocacy coalition members who were active participants involved in the policy debate were also cited as experts. Five of the six bills included evidence in related legislative documents. While documents included considerable evidence on the magnitude and severity of the obesity problem to justify policy enactment, there were a limited number of statements referring to policy effectiveness and only one statement identified attesting to implementation context and acceptability. Reference to evidence on related policy suggests policy precedence may also play an important role in policy decision making. There is a need to improve the dissemination of obesity policy effectiveness and implementation studies in a politically time sensitive manner to influence state health policy debates. Strategies are discussed to effectively integrate the use of research evidence in the state health policymaking process. \textcopyright{} 2019 The Authors},

The objective of this study was to identify the intensity and scope of social exclusion in an exploratory way and to look at the typology of existing exclusionary situations to inform policy making and professional practice. Data from 1009 users were collected by primary care social services professionals, completing the Social Exclusion Scale of the University of Alicante (SES-UA). The dimensions with the greatest levels of social exclusion in the study population were those related to work/employment, income and education and training. The dimensions with an intermediate level of exclusion were those related to housing and social isolation. Social acceptance, family and social conflict and health were the dimensions with the lowest levels of exclusion. The analysis also showed the existence of five significantly different groups, that showed five different life trajectories along the continuum between social exclusion and social inclusion. The results show the importance and utility of developing professional and policy intervention protocols based on research evidence, with the objective of improving the quality of life of the users. \textcopyright{} 2019 by the authors.

  volume = {130},
  abstract = {Background: While systematic review (SR) methods are gaining traction as a method for providing a reliable summary of existing evidence for health risks posed by exposure to chemical substances, it is becoming clear that their value is restricted to a specific range of risk management scenarios - in particular, those which can be addressed with tightly focused questions and can accommodate the time and resource requirements of a systematic evidence synthesis. Methods: The concept of a systematic evidence map (SEM) is defined and contrasted to the function and limitations of systematic review (SR) in the context of risk management decision-making. The potential for SEMs to facilitate evidence-based decision-making are explored using a hypothetical example in risk management priority-setting. The potential role of SEMs in reference to broader risk management workflows is characterised. Results: SEMs are databases of systematically gathered research which characterise broad features of the evidence base. Although not intended to substitute for the evidence synthesis element of systematic reviews, SEMs provide a comprehensive, queryable summary of a large body of policy relevant research. They provide an evidence-based approach to characterising the extent of available evidence and support forward looking predictions or trendspotting in the chemical risk sciences. In particular, SEMs facilitate the identification of related bodies of decision critical chemical risk information which could be further analysed using SR methods, and highlight gaps in the evidence which could be addressed with additional primary studies to reduce uncertainties in decision-making. Conclusions: SEMs have strong and growing potential as a high value tool in resource efficient use of existing research in chemical risk management. They can be used as a critical precursor to efficient deployment of high quality SR methods for characterising chemical health risks. Furthermore, SEMs have potential, at a large scale, to support the sort of evidence summarisation and surveillance methods which would greatly increase the resource efficiency, transparency and effectiveness of regulatory initiatives such as EU REACH and US TSCA. \textcopyright{} 2019 The Authors},

The Danish eHealth policies have very different framings following the different focus points for the policies. Interestingly, strategies for evaluating the devolopment of eHealth and eHealth policies were very sparcely noted in the policies. For the first time the de-emphasising of evaluations of eHealth policies in Denmark has been empirically demonstrated, thus undermining the objective of obtaining evidence-based eHealth policies. \textcopyright{} 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and IOS Press.},

The emergence of the concept of Cyber Physical System (CPS) and big data imperatively enable manufacturing to become smarter and more competitive among nations. Many researchers have proposed new solutions with big data enabling tools for manufacturing applications in three directions: product, production and business. Big data has been a fast-changing research area with many new opportunities for applications in manufacturing. This paper presents a systematic literature review of the state-of-the-art of big data in manufacturing. Six key drivers of big data applications in manufacturing have been identified. The key drivers are system integration, data, prediction, sustainability, resource sharing and hardware. Based on the requirements of manufacturing, nine essential components of big data ecosystem are captured. They are data ingestion, storage, computing, analytics, visualization, management, workflow, infrastructure and security. Several research domains are identified that are driven by available capabilities of big data ecosystem. Five future directions of big data applications in manufacturing are presented from modelling and simulation to real-time big data analytics and cybersecurity. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

  volume = {281},
  abstract = {Advances in Business Analytics in the era of Big Data have provided unprecedented opportunities for organizations to innovate. With insights gained from Business Analytics, companies are able to develop new or improved products/services. However, few studies have investigated the mechanism through which Business Analytics contributes to a firm's innovation success. This research aims to address this gap by theoretically and empirically investigating the relationship between Business Analytics and innovation. To achieve this aim, absorptive capacity theory is used as a theoretical lens to inform the development of a research model. Absorptive capacity theory refers to a firm's ability to recognize the value of new, external information, assimilate it and apply it to commercial ends. The research model covers the use of Business Analytics, environmental scanning, data-driven culture, innovation (new product newness and meaningfulness), and competitive advantage. The research model is tested through a questionnaire survey of 218 UK businesses. The results suggest that Business Analytics directly improves environmental scanning which in turn helps to enhance a company's innovation. Business Analytics also directly enhances data-driven culture that in turn impacts on environmental scanning. Data-driven culture plays another important role by moderating the effect of environmental scanning on new product meaningfulness. The findings demonstrate the positive impact of business analytics on innovation and the pivotal roles of environmental scanning and data-driven culture. Organizations wishing to realize the potential of Business Analytics thus need changes in both their external and internal focus. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier B.V.},

Drawing on the business analytics methodology (BAM) developed by Hindle and Vidgen (2018) we tackle this challenge through action research with a pseudonymous online travel company, EuroTravel. The method that emerges uses an opportunity canvas and a business ethics canvas to explore value creation and ethical aspects jointly. The business ethics canvas draws on the Markkula Center's five ethical principles (utility, rights, justice, common good, and virtue) to which explicit consideration of stakeholders is added. A contribution of the paper is to show how an ethical dimension can be embedded in the everyday exploration of analytics development opportunities, as distinct from a stand-alone ethical decision-making tool or as an overlay of a general set of guiding principles. We also propose that value and ethics should not be viewed as separate entities, rather they should be seen as inseparable and intertwined. \textcopyright{} 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

  volume = {52},
  shorttitle = {Avoid Being the {{Turkey}}},
  abstract = {In order for organisations to remain competitive in times of ambiguity and uncertainty, there is a need to detect and anticipate unknown unknowns, also called `black swans'. When these are ignored they may lead to competitive struggles. In this paper, we build on this view and suggest that big data analytics can provide necessary insights to help change strategy making. Research suggests that ambidextrous organisations should focus on developing and maintaining their dynamic capabilities. Following on from this, we take a dynamic capabilities perspective and propose a theoretical framework to explain the intricacies of big data analytics. This framework explains the ability of organisations to detect, anticipate and respond strategically in ambiguous and uncertain business environments. For a meta-synthesis of 101 cases of big data analytics, we employ a multi-method approach that incorporates Natural Language Processing, semantic analysis and case analysis, allowing extraction and analysis of structured information from unstructured data. Overall, we find evidence of big data analytics helping to detect, anticipate and respond to industry disruption. We offer six propositions about the relationships between the levels of data analytics capabilities and strategic dynamic capabilities. We find that descriptive data analytics improves the capability of an organisation to understand the business context (sensing) and that predictive data analytics aids in the realisation of business opportunities (seizing). This study contributes to an understanding of big data analytics as a dynamic organisational capability that supports strategic decision-making in times of ambiguity and uncertainty. We conclude by suggesting areas for further investigation, particularly in regard to the strategic application of prescriptive data analytics. \textcopyright{} 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

  shorttitle = {Big Data Analytics Capabilities and Knowledge Management},
  abstract = {Purpose: Big data analytics (BDA) guarantees that data may be analysed and categorised into useful information for businesses and transformed into big data related-knowledge and efficient decision-making processes, thereby improving performance. However, the management of the knowledge generated from the BDA as well as its integration and combination with firm knowledge have scarcely been investigated, despite an emergent need of a structured and integrated approach. The paper aims to discuss these issues. Design/methodology/approach: Through an empirical analysis based on structural equation modelling with data collected from 88 Italian SMEs, the authors tested if BDA capabilities have a positive impact on firm performances, as well as the mediator effect of knowledge management (KM) on this relationship. Findings: The findings of this paper show that firms that developed more BDA capabilities than others, both technological and managerial, increased their performances and that KM orientation plays a significant role in amplifying the effect of BDA capabilities. Originality/value: BDA has the potential to change the way firms compete through better understanding, processing, and exploiting of huge amounts of data coming from different internal and external sources and processes. Some managerial and theoretical implications are proposed and discussed in light of the emergence of this new phenomenon. \textcopyright{} 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

Complexity seems to be broad enough to accommodate very different positions and it has been seen as a unifying approach for evolutionary and neo-Schumpeterian streams. This pluralism is reflected in the fact that many authors that draw upon complexity ideas from neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary theory, make contrasting policy recommendations in terms of if it should be vertical or horizontal or if it should promote bottom-up process or direct interventions. This is possible because the complexity approach has not yet been fully developed and its limits are still somewhat blurred. In this paper, we propose to explore this idea by identifying the theoretical backgrounds and the policy recommendations of different groups of neo-Schumpeterian evolutionary authors. We propose that backgrounds focused on different attributes of complexity lead to different development policies recommendations.},

As people and firms specialize in different activities, economic efficiency increases, suggesting that development is associated with an increase in the number of individual activities and with the complexity that emerges from the interactions between them. Here we develop a view of economic growth and development that gives a central role to the complexity of a country's economy by interpreting trade data as a bipartite network in which countries are connected to the products they export, and show that it is possible to quantify the complexity of a country's economy by characterizing the structure of this network. Furthermore, we show that the measures of complexity we derive are correlated with a country's level of income, and that deviations from this relationship are predictive of future growth. This suggests that countries tend to converge to the level of income dictated by the complexity of their productive structures, indicating that development efforts should focus on generating the conditions that would allow complexity to emerge to generate sustained growth and prosperity.},

  abstract = {A country's mix of products predicts its subsequent pattern of diversification and economic growth. But does this product mix also predict income inequality? Here we combine methods from econometrics, network science, and economic complexity to show that countries exporting complex products\textemdash{}as measured by the Economic Complexity Index\textemdash{}have lower levels of income inequality than countries exporting simpler products. Using multivariate regression analysis, we show that economic complexity is a significant and negative predictor of income inequality and that this relationship is robust to controlling for aggregate measures of income, institutions, export concentration, and human capital. Moreover, we introduce a measure that associates a product to a level of income inequality equal to the average GINI of the countries exporting that product (weighted by the share the product represents in that country's export basket). We use this measure together with the network of related products\textemdash{}or product space\textemdash{}to illustrate how the development of new products is associated with changes in income inequality. These findings show that economic complexity captures information about an economy's level of development that is relevant to the ways an economy generates and distributes its income. Moreover, these findings suggest that a country's productive structure may limit its range of income inequality. Finally, we make our results available through an online resource that allows for its users to visualize the structural transformation of over 150 countries and their associated changes in income inequality during 1963\textendash{}2008.},

We complement these studies by introducing a probabilistic framework which leverages Bayesian non-parametric techniques to extract the dominant features behind the comparative advantage in exported products. Based on economic evidence and trade data, we place a restricted Indian Buffet Process on the distribution of countries' capability endowment, appealing to a culinary metaphor to model the process of capability acquisition. The approach comes with a unique level of interpretability, as it produces a concise and economically plausible description of the instantiated capabilities.},

Inspection of the country databases of exported products shows that this is not the case: successful countries are extremely diversified, in analogy with biosystems evolving in a competitive dynamical environment. The challenge is assessing quantitatively the non-monetary competitive advantage of diversification which represents the hidden potential for development and growth. Here we develop a new statistical approach based on coupled non-linear maps, whose fixed point defines a new metrics for the country Fitness and product Complexity. We show that a non-linear iteration is necessary to bound the complexity of products by the fitness of the less competitive countries exporting them. We show that, given the paradigm of economic complexity, the correct and simplest approach to measure the competitiveness of countries is the one presented in this work.
