## Resubmission

This is a resubmission.

In this version I have :

* changed the name of the functions by withdrawing the sqs mentions.
* have added a new function, spir_visual, allowing people to create visuals from the SPI data.

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.2
* microsoft (on appveyor), release
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.

* This is an update.
