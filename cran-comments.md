## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. This package did not fail the CRAN's test yet, but we realised there was an issue with Appveyor. We fixed it.

In this version I have :

* Fixed the Appveyor error by specifying the R version(release)

## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.6.1
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.6.1
* microsoft (on appveyor), release
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 0 note

## Downstream dependencies
There are currently no downstream dependencies for this package.

* This is a new release.
